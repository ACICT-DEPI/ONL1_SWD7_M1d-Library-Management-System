Library Management System as a DEPI project
Develop an application to manage Library borrowing and returns activities. Consider the following information gathered during the analysis process
Design:
• Basic Classes: Library, Contents, Books, Articles, Digital Media, Subscribers, Borrowing Records, and have the following relationships:
• A library content can be a book, an article in a journal, or digital media.
• A subscriber can borrow any of the library contents, for three weeks, golden subscribers can borrow for three months, after the lease time is over, a fee accrue on the subscriber until the borrowed item is returned.
• A Librarian/administrator can print a report about all borrowed books and rank them according to audience interest rates, can save/load data on and from files.

Your extra suggestions are welcome, especially to organize main function, display a menu to the user to:
o Adding/editing/deleting instances belonging to each class,
o Subscriber browsing library contents and select items to borrow.
o Subscriber returning borrowed item and check his balance and pay any late fee if any.
o Admin can print reports of overdue borrowed items.
